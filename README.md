Slay the Spire mod that adds a new character: The Mystic

To play this mod, you need your game to be updated and not in beta branch, you need the latest version of ModTheSpire, and you need the latest version of BaseMod.

ModTheSpire:
https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire

BaseMod:
https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod

Place ModTheSpire.jar in your SlayTheSpire main directory.  
Create a "mods" subfolder inside your SlayTheSpire main directory, then place BaseMod.jar and The Mystic.jar into it.

To play the mod, launch ModTheSpire, enable BaseMod and The Mystic, then hit Play!

Additionally, the mod includes support for the mod named "Friendly Minions". If you have Friendly Minions installed, then you can use an additonal card called "Summon Familiar". Mystic Mod does *not* require Friendly Minions to run, but Summon Familiar will not be offered as a card reward if you wish to use it.

If you wish to install FriendlyMinions and summon your own Fox Familiar, it can be found here:

New character:   
The Mystic. A mysterious master of two opposed disciplines. With a blade in one hand and a spellbook in the other, she outmatches her opponents with Sword and Sorcery.

Card Subypes:  
Along with the base card types (Attack, Skill, and Power), most Mystic cards include one of two new Subtypes: "Arte" and "Spell". These subtypes, and effects that care about them, form the core of The Mystic's mechanics. A card that is an Attack or a Skill can *also* be one of these two new subtypes, and any properties that apply to a normal attack or skill still apply if it happens to be an Arte or a Spell.

Keywords:  
Arcane: card has a special effect if you played a spell that turn  
Technical: same as energized, but with Artes.  
Cantrip: a special colorless card that some effects can generate. Count as a spell if you haven't played 2 spells yet.
